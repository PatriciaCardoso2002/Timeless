Certainly! Here's another example of a stored procedure that retrieves all soundtracks associated with a program:

CREATE PROCEDURE GetProgramSoundtracks
    @programId INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT
        TM.*
    FROM
        TIMELESS_MUSICA TM
    INNER JOIN
        TIMELESS_SOUNDTRACKTEM TST ON TM.idMusica = TST.idMusica
    INNER JOIN
        TIMELESS_SOUNDTRACK TS ON TST.codigoSoundTrack = TS.codigoSoundTrack
    WHERE
        TS.idPrograma = @programId;
END
This stored procedure takes @programId as an input parameter and returns all soundtracks associated with that program. It joins the TIMELESS_MUSICA table with the TIMELESS_SOUNDTRACKTEM and TIMELESS_SOUNDTRACK tables based on the corresponding foreign key relationships. The result includes the details of the soundtracks from the TIMELESS_MUSICA table.

To execute this stored procedure, you can pass the program ID as a parameter:

sql
Copy code
EXEC GetProgramSoundtracks @programId = 1;
Make sure to adjust the parameter value to match the program ID you want to retrieve the soundtracks for.

Feel free to modify and enhance these stored procedures according to your specific requirements and table structure.
